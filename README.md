# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using MNIST
My first simple ML model using the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.

## Overview
Check out [mnist_torch.py](https://github.com/JolieeZhuu/mnist-reader/blob/main/mnist_torch.py) for the model using PyTorch!
I'm planning to update my other file so I can test out numpy as well.

## Improvements (Further Goals)
I want to change some of the parameters and settings in my code to see how it would affect the processing speed and accuracy.
I also want to extend this model to recognize handwritten letters and characters from other languages!
